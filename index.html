  ###Why web
  - Always wanted a hands on experience
  - Like the nested slide layout
  - Good for interactive demos over web (no alt+tab)
  - Easy support over all smart devices

    ## Cutting the corners
    - Jpeg quantization tables
    - Websockets
    - Prefetching

      - Lower resolution tiles first
      - For smooth navigation

    # Memory mapped files

    - Map files in virtual memory and access data directly instead of file io system calls
    - Efficient access for large files
    - Easy to share large file resources across processes

  ### Performance tests
  - Selenium to complete user interaction for a particular configuration
  - Reports statistics (response time, latency etc)
  ### Unit tests
  Internal API tests, also useful to demonstrate usage
  ### Smoke test
  Selenium to complete user interaction

# Latest/Future considerations
- Portable embeddeble module
- Use of memory maps for TIFF storage
- ZeroMQ connected server and image tile serving microservices
- Continuous integration
- Distribution as a plugin for girder
